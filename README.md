# Golf by NM 🏌️‍♂️

**Golf by NM** is a high-fidelity Android golf simulator built with **Jetpack Compose** and a professional ballistics engine. It implements the industry-standard **9-Laws of Ball Flight** to provide realistic feedback on every shot, from a pure drive to a heavy slice.

## ⛳ Features

- **Professional Physics Engine**: 
    - Implements the **9-Laws of Ball Flight** (80/20 rule for initial direction).
    - Advanced aerodynamics including **Drag** and **Magnus Effect** (Lift) for realistic curvature.
    - Dynamic spin decay and ground roll based on descent angle and peak height.
- **Interactive 3-Zone Layout**:
    - **ZONE DATA (Top 20%)**: Live dashboard with Carry, Ball Speed, Swing Path, Face-to-Path, AoA, Height, and Lateral Deviation.
    - **ZONE ACTION (Middle 55%)**: 2.5D visual environment with distance markers, bunkers, and multiple environments (Air, Sea, Mountain, Urban, etc.).
    - **ZONE SETUP (Bottom 25%)**: Interactive impact ball to set Attack Angle and Face Angle, and a complete golf bag (Driver to Lob Wedge).
- **Multiple Environments**: Switch between different scenic driving ranges with high-quality background textures.
- **Dynamic Swing Arc**: Visual representation of your swing path and speed.

## 🚀 Physics: The 9-Laws Engine

The simulator follows professional ballistic rules defined in `PhysicsEngine.kt`:
- **Initial Direction**: 80% determined by **Face Angle** and 20% by **Swing Path**.
- **Spin & Curvature**:
    - **Backspin**: Influenced by club loft and Attack Angle (compression).
    - **Sidespin**: Generated by the delta between Swing Path and Face Angle (Face-to-Path).
- **Perspective & Scaling**:
    - Aggressive 3D scaling (ball shrinks as it travels).
    - Horizon-mapped distance (max 320m compression).

### Trajectory Mapping Table
| Swing Path | Face relative to Path | Trajectory Effect |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Square | Square | **Straight** |
| In-to-Out (+) | Square | **Draw** |
| In-to-Out (+) | Open (+) | **Push** |
| In-to-Out (+) | Closed (-) | **Hook** |
| Out-to-In (-) | Square | **Fade** |
| Out-to-In (-) | Closed (-) | **Pull** |
| Out-to-In (-) | Open (+) | **Slice** |

## 🏗️ Build & Setup

1. Open the project in **Android Studio (Ladybug or newer)**.
2. Ensure you have **JDK 17+** configured.
3. Sync Gradle and run the `app` module on a physical device or emulator.
4. Use touch gestures in the **Zone Action** to simulate your swing.
